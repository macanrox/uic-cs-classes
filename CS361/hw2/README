README
======
The purpose of the assignment is to create two programs, one that creates a simple shell and another to use the Monte Carlo method by handling several different signals.

Included in the .zip file are:
simpleShell.c
monteCarloSimulation.c
header.h
README
makefile

Running the makefile will generate two executables called shell and monteCarlo.

shell is a makeshift shell which will print out the ACCC name (and ID), and allows users to enter a shell command. While running shellC, the user can run monteCarloC to generate randomized iterations generated by the Monte Carlo simulation.

====
NOTE
====
The Monte Carlo Simulation program is unfinished and will not run properly.

Entering a numerical value or a non-unix command while running shell command prompts an execute error message.
