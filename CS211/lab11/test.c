 d <int> - delete the integer value from the linked list. Be sure to properly deallocate the nodes in the linked list.
 c <int> - display a message stating whether the given integer value is contained in the linked list.
 e - empty all values from the linked list. Be sure to properly deallocate the nodes in the linked list.
 l - list the items contained in the linked list.
 r - list the items contained in the linked list in reverse order.
